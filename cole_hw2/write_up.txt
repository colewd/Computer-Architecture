I think I was 100% successful with this project.

My approach to this problem was to write it using bitsets first 
so it was easier to understand and wrap my head around. Then, 
once I got it working, I went through each section of the code 
replacing bitsets with integers to follow the assignment specifications.

There weren't problems I encountered that I was not able
to resolve with this project. I ran all the examples provided 
and my output matched the expected output. I included a check to
see if the exponent of the result was equal to 255 so I can
make sure the result is infinity if the user added two large inputs
that caused an overflow.
