I believe I was 100% successful with this assignment.

Using the example code, I implemented the switch statement
to print out the necessary information. My output matches the expected
output listed in the example code. I used the fork method to create 
a child process. On the parent's return, it prints out that it created
a child process with it's ppid, then it stores a string in the msg_buf.
When the child's case is returned from fork() it will print out the parents
message and also it's own process and thread information.

There were no errors I was not able to fix for this assignment.
