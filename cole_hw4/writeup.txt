I think I was 100% successful with this project.

My approach to this problem was to first understand the rshift 
solution. I then wrote some pencil and paper
solutions to the multipication and divison so I would know
what variables are needed to solve the operations. Multiplcation
was fairly easy because you just add n amount of times then 
check if the result was of the opposite sign bit, which would
indicate overflow. Divison was much longer to implement. I knew
that all divisions can be viewed as multiplications and additions.
So I wrote up a solution on paper then converted it to microcode.

There were no problems I encountered that I was not able
to resolve with this project.
