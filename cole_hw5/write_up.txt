I think I was 100% successful with this project.

My approach to the assignment was to start with the code provided for us,
"IO_scan_two_numbers". I first broke some of the sections into functions 
and added call/retn statements. I made sure the program still worked before continuing. 
Then I wrote the addInput section which simply prompted the user for input and read
input twice. I added the result and stored it on the stack where the
user specified. (This is the address that's pushed on the stack before
calling the addInput function). Then, I had to encode the values for 
each number in the result. I did this by utilizing the remainder and
quotient from the divide function in assignment 4. After, I simply
popped each ascii number from the stack and printed it. If I encountered
an ascii value less than 48, I was done.
