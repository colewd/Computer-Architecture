I think I was 100% successful with this assignment.

My approach to this problem was to first understand the iterative example. 
I then wrote a c program to better understand how I'd do the recursion. I knew that
I'd have to call fib(n-1), store the result, and call fib(n-2).
And then I'd just have to put the addition result in the accumulator
and move the stack pointer to the return address.

There were no problems I encountered that I was not able
to resolve with this project. I ran the examples provided and my answer matched.
